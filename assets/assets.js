    question: "What details should my design request include?",

    <ul>
    <li>- Start with a brief project overview, outlining the goal and purpose of the design.</li>

    <li>- Include any content—text, images, and other elements—and specify format, size, and file types.</li>
    <li>-  Don’t forget to mention your timeline, budget, and any competitors or references that inspire you. The more detail, the better!</li>

  {
    question:
      "Does Salicha delivered original work, or provide just a templates?",
    answer: `At <strong>Salicha</strong>, we do not use templates, we delivers unique, custom designs not relies on templates. Template-based work isn’t tailored to the client; it’s a generic concept available to anyone. While templates are often low-cost or even free, they lack the personal touch and may result in a logo or web design that’s shared with multiple businesses, potentially even competitors. This can lead to designs that don’t fully represent your brand’s message.
<br/><br/>
In contrast, custom design work is crafted from scratch by our talented team of designers, who take the time to understand your brand, message, and goals. At <strong>Salicha</strong>, we begin with a creative brief, then create multiple design concepts. After refining these with our creative director, we present you with five to seven completely original designs tailored specifically to your brand. Our commitment is to deliver designs that are 100% unique and aligned with your vision.`,
  },

  {
    question: "What is the design process",
    answer: `At <strong>Salicha</strong>, our design process is tailored to ensure your vision is fully realized. Here’s how we work:
<ul>
<li>- Discovery Phase: We dive deep into understanding your brand, values, and target audience.</li>

<li>- Creative Brief: We craft a detailed brief to align on objectives and expectations.</li>

<li>- Concept Development: Our designers create initial concepts based on the brief, exploring different styles.</li>

<li>- Feedback & Refinement: We collaborate with you, refining the designs based on your feedback.</li>

<li>- Final Presentation: We present unique, polished designs, allowing you to choose the best fit for your brand.</li>

At <strong>Salicha</strong>, we focus on delivering designs that truly reflect your brand’s identity.
</ul>

  {
    question: "Do I own the rights to my design?",
